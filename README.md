- 👋 Hi, I’m @Owen-Bern
- 👀 I’m interested in water brake engine dynos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA, NetBeans, Arduino coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find or create the arduino code for the repository of beremm14/BESDyno. It looks like the Java code is there.
- I need to find out how to set up the proper data bus for this project, at the arduino end. I am totally unfamiliar with netbeans and java, so it will take me a while to get sorted out.
- <edit1>
  I have found the Arduino code - files ending in ".ino"
  Much of this is written in German, so I will translate bits as I go.
  For HTML READMEs, I can just take JPG images of the on-line translation.
  
  I now need the Arduino IDE and the Arduino Libraries.
  I also need to find how the windows file structure should be set up, and how to run from a .JAR file?  Possibly initiated from the NetBeans IDE??
  
- I just want to monitor rpm and weight instruments, so I will find the equivalent inputs , get them set up, and comment out the others.
