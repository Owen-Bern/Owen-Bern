- 👋 Hi, I’m @Owen-Bern
- 👀 I’m interested in water brake engine dynos
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA, NetBeans.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find or create the arduino code for the repository of beremm14/BESDyno. It looks like the Java code is there.
- I need to find out how to set up the proper data bus for this project, at the arduino end. I am totally unfamiliar with netbeans and java, so it will take me a while to get sorted out.
- I just want to monitor rpm and weight instruments.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Email "nieuweo"@slingshot.co.nz
