- 👋 Hi, I’m @Owen-Bern
- 👀 I’m interested in water brake engine dynos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA, NetBeans, Arduino coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find or create the arduino code for the repository of beremm14/BESDyno. It looks like the Java code is there.
- I need to find out how to set up the proper data bus for this project, at the arduino end. I am totally unfamiliar with netbeans and java, so it will take me a while to get sorted out.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Email "nieuweo"@slingshot.co.nz

  I have found the Arduino code - files ending in ".ino"
  Much of README, Labels,  is written in German, so I will translate bits as I go.
  For HTML READMEs, I can just take JPG images of the on-line translation.
  
  I now need the Arduino IDE and the Arduino Libraries.
  I also need to find how the windows file structure should be set up, and how to run from a .JAR file?  Possibly initiated from the NetBeans IDE??
  
- I just want to monitor rpm and weight instruments, so I will find the equivalent inputs , get them set up, and comment out the others.
  
  
  The java code is pretty disconnected with no internal comments, and there are tons of xml programs, also with no comments.
  Probably typical of code generator systems?
  I will see if I can get it to load in "NetBeans" , and see if it makes more sense there.
  The arduino software looks simple and straighforward. That shouldn't be hard to modify. I will also add a higher level of commenting!
  
  Forward plan:  discard the PC gui for now. - use bits of the arduino code, and develop up for 7 inch lcd touchscreen, micro SD card write.  This means I discard the 
  high-res graphs and printout capability, but everything else can be done on the arduino, using very simple program structure.
  I just need "start run" "stop run"  peak power/rpm display, write results to SD, clock module for creating file keys.
